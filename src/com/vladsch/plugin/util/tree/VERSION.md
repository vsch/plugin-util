* [ ] Fix: Move Recursion predicate to `ValueIterationAdapter` from `TreeIterator` and put
      `Recurse()` back into `VoidIteration` interface to allow value iteration adapter to
      control recursion.
* [ ] Add: `boolean IsReversed()` to `IterationConditions` so consumers or provider points can
      rebel if they don't work with reverse iterations.
